# Loan Prediction Analysis


### 📊 Loan Prediction Using Machine Learning
🚀 Project Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a loan application will be approved or not based on various applicant details. Accurate loan prediction helps financial institutions minimize risks and streamline the loan approval process.

 
 ### 🛠 Tech Stack

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- ML Algorithms: Logistic Regression,KNeighborsClassifier,DecisionTreeClassifier,
GaussianNB,SVC
- Environment: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code



### Dataset

- Source: Kaggle
- Features include
 - Applicant Income: Income of the applicant
- Coapplicant Income: Income of the coapplicant
- Loan Amount: Requested loan amount
- Credit History: Record of previous credit repayments
- Marital Status, Education, Property - Area: Categorical features
- Target: Loan Status (Approved/Not Approved) 

and so on.



### 🛠 Data Preprocessing

Handling Missing Values: Imputation using mean, median, or mode.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Label encoding and one-hot encoding.
Feature Scaling: Standardization for numerical features.
### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)



- Visualizations:heatmaps ,barplots etc.
